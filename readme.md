# Adventuron Christmas Game Jam entry

A text adventure to save Christmas with the help of your feathery friends

## Feathery Christmas

This is the big day. It is almost time for the delivery, but all your reindeers are unable to move!
How will you find a way to give all children's gifts? You cannot just find steeds to roam the skies freely, can you?
But you are Santa, and Santa always finds a way.

This is a small, heartwarming Christmas story you can play with your kids.

## How to play

This is a classical text adventure game.
To act, you need to input a VERB and a SUBJECT, or simply a VERB. 
You'll need to EXAMINE your surroundings and the various objects you can find, or LOOK; there are various synonyms accepted (or shortcuts, like X for EXAMINE). 
You can GIVE or TAKE objects.
To move on the map, you can use the cardinal directions, NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST (or shortcuts N, E, S, W); there are some places you can ENTER or EXIT.
