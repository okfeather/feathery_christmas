Before your eyes, you see all the pigeons dispatching the gifts before them. After a calm pause, they all start taking flight: in one instant, there are as many pigeons as stars in the sky; carrying their glittering gifts! All thanks to your optimized route!


You are in front of a big Christmas tree, you see that Larry's friend Columbia safely delivered a lot of the presents.

You see some kids, like Robin, happily screaming 'I can't wait to play Call Of Beauty!' With your help, the pigeons could deliver the gifts to all children.

CONGRATULATIONS!

YOU WON THE GAME!

LARRY AND HIS TROOPS COULD DELIVER ALL PRESENTS!

TO THANK THEM, YOU PROMISED TO COME BACK AND GIVE THEM VINTAGE 'THE NOTORIOUS GROUSE' DRINK, WITH SOME PANETTONE AND CASTELLA.

THANKS TO YOU, ALL KIDS AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE HAPPY ON CHRISTMAS!
