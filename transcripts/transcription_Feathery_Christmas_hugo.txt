This is Santa's cellar, where you can normally find different potions to stay cheerful and full of energy. You remember having told the reindeer of these drinks' benefits, so that's probably why they've been drinking a lot. However, they don't seem full of energy. You decide to leave the cellar to get fresh air.

You see a map of the village.
